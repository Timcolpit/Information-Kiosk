        LASA Robotics is the robotics team of the Liberal Arts and Science Academy (formerly the Science Academy), a public magnet high school in Austin, Texas. Founded in 1983 by Tony Bertucci, the team is dedicated to teaching engineering principles to students, both within our own team and our community. We have around 50 student members, participate in competitions, and make community outreach a priority throughout the entire year.

 The ausTIN CANs provide students with real-world experiences.
                        In 2012, we garnered support from Rackspace and 3-Day Startup to
                        co-found <strong>High School Startup</strong>. High School Startup teaches teens
                        the value of entrepreneurship within engineering by engaging
                        them in the <strong>creation of a product</strong>. It takes students through
                        phases of product development - <strong>brainstorming, market research,
                        prototyping, and launch</strong>. Students crowdfunded their projects,
                        including a new gearbox for robotics, a smartphone app for FRC
                        scouting, and a musical instrument tuner. The gearbox group was
                        <strong>featured on the Kickstarter</strong> homepage as a November 2012 Staff
                        Pick; their project video was watched over 15,000 times. The
                        success of the initial High School Startup is <strong>leading to its
                        expansion</strong> and consultation for programs in San Antonio and San
                        Francisco.      </section>

        In the last seven years, we’ve hosted <b>25 robotics competitions</b> and volunteered at countless more. We use FLL, FTC, and VEX qualifiers, FRC scrimmages, and other robotics events to grow and promote FIRST. We forged the Austin FTC community in 2007 with the creation and funding of <b>the area’s first 14 teams</b> and proceeded to nurture teams through donation of materials, events, workshops, and training. This year, we again supported the growth of FTC in our community by donating material valued at <b>$20,000</b> to nearby schools. We encouraged our local middle schools to develop robotics programs to help found <b>24 VEX teams</b> and donated VEX kits to UT Austin’s Robotics and Automation Society as part of an ongoing partnership. In conjunction with NI, UT, and Skillpoint Alliance, we hosted <b>3 training events for teachers</b> interested in adding FLL and FTC to their classrooms. Over the past 5 summers, we’ve hosted week-long camps for students in grades 3-10, culminating in research presentations and competitions. Many of the <b>400 young campers</b> we’ve introduced to FIRST have joined FRC teams or taken robotics classes in high school. Summer camps provide funding, long-term team sustainability, and growth while inspiring the next generation.

      <header class="subtitle">Texas Robot Roundup</header>

      <section class="eighty-mod left">
        During the summer of 2011, we hosted the first annual Texas Robot Roundup, the first official Texas FRC off-season competition. Known as TRR, it has served as a model for new off-seasons in our state. NI, Time Warner Cable, FIRST in Texas, and the Alamo Region have partnered with our team to support the event. We work with our parent organization, mentors, and students, and many other local teams and professionals, all who serve as volunteers and provide an opportunity for teams throughout Texas and beyond to compete in the off-season. Teams can iterate their designs, try out new drivers, introduce new members, mentors, sponsors, and community members to FIRST, and attend workshops. Workshop topics include robot design, programming, team sustainability, non-engineering mentoring, strategy, and design panel discussions lead by representatives from Texas’ most successful teams to help strengthen the Texas FIRST community. TRR continues to attract more teams each year, growing from 27 robots in 2011 to 42 robots in 2013 and in 2014, we had 34 FRC robots and 10 FTC robots. This summer, we hosted TRR at NIWeek with the addition of FTC to the competitions.<br><br>
TRR has been a platform for giving Texas teams a strong start. Weeks before the first TRR, we traveled to Killeen, TX, and helped the pre-rookies, Shadetree Mechanics Team 3999, to build a robot and compete at TRR. We provided access to parts, facilities, and expertise. Shadetree went on to win the 2012 Alamo Regional Rookie All-Star Award. Three more of the eight teams that the CANs assisted during their first year similarly received rookie recognitions: 2468, 2881, and 3320. Recently, TIN CANs members inspired VEX students at Cedar Park HS to volunteer at TRR and start rookie FRC Team 5052. This past summer, a new homeschool pre-rookie team from north Austin made their first FIRST appearance at TRR with a robot we helped them build during the off-season.

        Our monthly, TED-esque talks allow the public, specifically students, to listen and interact with industry professionals, who share their stories and answer questions from the crowd. All talks are public, and recorded, then published online on our YouTube channel, for anyone to view. Past talks have exposed students to dozens of personal, informative presentations that help prepare them for a career in STEM or otherwise.
